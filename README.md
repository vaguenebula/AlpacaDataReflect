# AlpacaDataReflect
An experiment to see if chatgpt can improve the output of the stanford alpaca dataset

Advantages
- Very detailed
- Sometimes more accurate
- More creative story telling and poem writing

Limitations
- Too verbose for tasks asking for limited information 
- Listing more items than required
- Sometimes over-corrects original output
- Sometimes mentions "here is updated version"

TODO:
- Think of ways to improve outputs further (having chatgpt select output that follows instruction closely)
- Train LORA / finetune
